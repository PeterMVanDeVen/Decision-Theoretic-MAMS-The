# This script requires that the R script 'Functions for selecting the best from
# three, four or five experimental arms.R' was previously run and packages snow, 
# doSNOW and doParallel for parallel computing were installed.
# The required R script can be downloaded from 
# https://github.com/PeterMVanDeVen/Decision-Theoretic-MAMS-trials

# This example illustrates the use of the following functions for the 
# setting with five experimental arms: 
#
# create.d  : Simulates trial data;
# prdrop    : Evaluates characteristics for trials when arms can be 
#             dropped;
# prnodrop  : Evaluates characteristics for trials without dropping of 
#             arms;
# pcalc     : Summarizes trial characteristics
# reevaluate: Reevaluates characteristics of trials obtained by prdrop
#             and prnodrop for higher thresholds C/Q  
#
# Required functions provided in separate R script

# Packages snow, doSNOW an doParallel are required for parallel 
# computing
